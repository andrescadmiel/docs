## Welcome

The WikiChat API allows you to integrate our powerful chat functionality into your applications. Our REST API is designed to be simple, predictable, and easy to use.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api.wikichat.com/v1
```

## Authentication

WikiChat uses API keys to authenticate requests. You can view and manage your API keys in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.wikichat.com).

Include your API key in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.wikichat.com/v1/chats
```

<Warning>
Keep your API keys secure and never share them publicly. Use environment variables to store them safely.
</Warning>

## Rate Limiting

The API is rate limited to ensure fair usage:

- **Free Plan**: 100 requests per minute
- **Pro Plan**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1640995200
```

## Error Handling

The API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate success or failure:

| Status Code | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| 200 | Success |
| 400 | Bad Request - Invalid parameters |
| 401 | Unauthorized - Invalid API key |
| 403 | Forbidden - Insufficient permissions |
| 404 | Not Found - Resource doesn't exist |
| 429 | Too Many Requests - Rate limit exceeded |
| 500 | Internal Server Error |

Error responses include a JSON object with more details:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_request",
    "message": "The request is missing required parameters",
    "details": {
      "missing_fields": ["name", "email"]
    }
  }
}
```
